# Foundation
This is the scaffold for making real-time and single execution programs in C in windows (no other OSs suported yet). This projects reuses and adapts code from https://github.com/Mr-4th-Programming and https://youtu.be/NG_mUhc8LRw.

Notice how the application does not freeze when resizing (thanks to https://youtu.be/NG_mUhc8LRw).
